% Unknown Flow Rates (to be calculated)
% Define variables for the unknown flow rates
% For example, F3, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F10, ...
F3=CO2+H2;
F3*1/3*=F4

% Example of a linear equation for a unit operation (adjust as needed)
% For instance, based on the reaction CO2 + 3H2 â†’ CH3OH + H2O
% Use the mole balance equation for CH3OH:
% F3 * X_CO2 - F5 * X_CO2 = -F9 * X_CH3OH
% where X_CO2 is the molar fraction of CO2 in stream 3, X_CH3OH is the molar fraction of CH3OH in stream 9
% and other variables are flow rates.

% Define the coefficient matrix A and the right-hand side vector B for the system of equations
% A * unknown_flow_rates = B

% Example:
% A(1, 1) = X_CO2 - X_CO2; % Coefficient for the first equation
% A(1, 2) = -X_CO2;        % Coefficient for the second equation
% B(1) = -F9 * X_CH3OH;

% Solve the system of linear equations
unknown_flow_rates = A \ B;
